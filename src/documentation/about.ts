# About Topos
	
## The Topos Project
	
Topos is an experimental web based algorithmic sequencer programmed by **BuboBubo** ([Raphaël Forment](https://raphaelforment.fr)) and **Amiika** ([Miika Alonen](https//github.com/amiika)). It is written using [TypeScript](https://google.fr) and [Vite](https://google.fr). Many thanks to Felix Roos for making the [Superdough](https://www.npmjs.com/package/superdough) audio backend available for experimentation. This project is based on the [Monome Teletype](https://monome.org) by [Brian Crabtree](https://nnnnnnnn.co/) and [Kelli Cain](https://kellicain.com/). We hope to follow and honor the same spirit of sharing and experimentation. How much can the Teletype be extended while staying accessible and installation-free?
	
## About Live Coding
	
**Amiika** and I are both very involved in the [TOPLAP](https://toplap.org) and [Algorave](https://algorave.com) scenes. We previously worked on the [Sardine](https://sardine.raphaelforment.fr) live coding environment for Python. **Amiika** has been working hard on its own algorithmic pattern language called [Ziffers](https://github.com/amiika/ziffers). A version of it is available in Topos! **Raphaël** is doing live coding with other folks from the [Cookie Collective](https://cookie.paris) and from the city of Lyon (France).
